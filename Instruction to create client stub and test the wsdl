Please find the below steps to create a client application 
to utilise and test the wsdl provided here for test. The 
steps are applicable to any WTP (Web Tool Platform) version 
of eclipse IDE.

1. Save the wsdl to a location.
2. Open Java EE perspective (should be default).
3. File-> New-> Other-> Web Services-> Web Service Client and press next.
4. In service definition select the downloaded wsdl file.
5. Client Type-> Java Proxy
6. Select slide bar till "Test Client".
7. In Configuration, select the available runtime server (for example Tomcat v8.5 Server).
8. In Configuration, select a web service runtime as well (for example Apache Axis).
9. In Configuration, select a new Client Project (i.e, give a name to your client project
such as SOAPExampleClient and select Dynamic Web Project as your client project type.
10. Click Next and Next.
11. Select only methods you want to test (for example in our case select sayHelloWorld() only)
and click finish.
12. Eclipse browser will open the TestClient.jsp page.
13. Select the method sayHelloWorld() and enter your name in the input field.
14. Click invoke to see the result below.

This can be accessed through any external browser such as crome using the same url in 
the eclipse screen. The url for our case would be 
http://localhost:8080/SOAPExampleClient/sampleHelloWorldProxy/TestClient.jsp
