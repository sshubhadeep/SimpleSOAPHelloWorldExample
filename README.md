# SimpleSOAPHelloWorldExample
A simple SOAP web service implementation

This project aims to create a wsdl (a Hello World SOAP Web Service) file that can be consumed from anywhere to implement the method (or service for which the web service is created). We need a client stub to test the generated wsdl and documentation with instructions on ‘how to create the client stub and test the wsdl’ is added to the project.
